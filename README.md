# Mortgage-Backed-Securities-Pricing-Tool
The goal of this project is to valuate a mortgage backed security with refinancing risk.
Each security contains a pool of identical mortgages that we for simplicity will value as one.The mortgage borrower retains the right to pay back his outstanding balance at any time. The point of the project is to value the MBS, and measure its duration and convexity. The motivation for using a model such as Black Derman & Toy is that the prepayment feature amounts to an option contract. Option values are critically dependendent on the volatility of the underlying source of risk. In a simpler stock option setting all we care about are the dynamics of the stock price and the level of its volatility. Here we care about the dynamics of interest rates across the whole maturity spectrum. As a result we observe not only a whole term structure of zero coupon bond yields but also a full term structure of matching volatilities.
